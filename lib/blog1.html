            </p>
             <li> <p><strong>Simplicity:-</strong> It use JSX file which makes application simple and easy to understnd as well as code. </p></li>
             <li><p> <strong>Open-Source:-</strong> It isan open source framework which we can open code and reuse it. </p></li>
             <li> <p><strong>JSX:-</strong> stands for Javascript XML.It is an syntax extension to javascript.It allows to write and add HTML in react.</p></li>

                <strong>One Data Binding:-</strong>  One-way binding of data means data can be bind from component to view and in one-direction. 
                 As reactjs is based on component based approach so this language is a designed in such manner that follows uni-directional flow or one-way binding.The advantage of one-way binding give you better control throughout the application.
